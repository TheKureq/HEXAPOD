## About:
This is the repository of the academic project which my friends and I are developing. By any means is it perfect, but we will work **HARD** to improve the functionality and make it work! 

What we want to achieve:

- Develop a functional control system for the **HEXAPOD** robot,
- Learn more about Raspberry Pi (i.e. HALF-Duplex UART communication),
- Learn about ROS2 software,
- Learn about Docker and contenerized environments,
- Learn about robotics (especially inverse kinematics),
- Learn about OOP programming in python and ROS2,
- Learn how to use Git & GitHub to collaborate.

### First success:
We created a closed loop control system utilizing:
- Publisher node,
- Subscriber node,
- ROS2 service,
- Turtlesim demo.

### Successful connection:
We managed to connect the servos and made sure that all 18 of them were working! ðŸ¥³

### First Stand up:
After few attempts HEXAPOD can finaly stand up easily! Still a lot of work to do, but we are ready to migrate the prototype Python scripts to ROS2 to control all of the servos simultaneously.
