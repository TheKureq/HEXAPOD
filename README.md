## About:
This is the repository of the academic project which my friends and I are developing. By any means is it perfect, but we will work **HARD** to improve the functionality and make it work! 

What we want to achieve:

- Develop a functional control system for the **HEXAPOD** robot,
- Learn more about Raspberry Pi (i.e. HALF-Duplex UART communication),
- Learn about ROS2 software,
- Learn about Docker and contenerized environments,
- Learn about robotics (especially inverse kinematics),
- Learn about OOP programming in python and ROS2,
- Learn how to use Git & GitHub to collaborate.

### First success:
We created a closed loop control system utilizing:
- Publisher node,
- Subscriber node,
- ROS2 service,
- Turtlesim demo.

### Successful connection:
We managed to connect the servos and made sure that all 18 of them were working! ðŸ¥³

### First Stand up:
After few attempts HEXAPOD can finaly stand up easily! Still a lot of work to do, but we are ready to migrate the prototype Python scripts to ROS2 to control all of the servos simultaneously.

### Controlling all of the servos /w Inverse Kinematics:
Many hours and iterations later we finally managed to use the ROS2 capabilities to move every leg simultaneously! To achieve this we used:
- improved code structure - we moved every leg into one file and made separate functions for each leg,
- custom interface, which is basically an array of positions for the servos,
- different packet structure for controlling the servos - we used a Dynamixel's class called "GroupSyncWrite" to minimize the number of the messages sent (just 6 now!),
- launch file, which spawns a separate process for each of the legs and for the body, allowing us to execute them at the same time.

### First walk:
After a while, we implemented a leg trajectory with leg inverse kinematics calculation and a walking gaits template. For now, we use only one walking gait pattern but, we never know if we need some more in the future, so we prepare architecture for this scenario. Right now, we are thinking about improving the ttl speed for faster movements or changing publisher/subscriber for services. 
summary:
- implemented leg trajectory and walking gaits
- added some more custom messages, ex. controll_status msg for future easier robot control and machine state of the robot.
- changed code architecture a bit

Actual problems:
- ttl half-duplex communication is too slow for 18 axes working that fast

Next improvements and development:
- changing some of mechanics, 3d printed less slippery foot caps
- wireless keyboard / Xbox controller control of walking
- rotating while walking
- code optimization
- IMU sensor implementation and body roll pitch compensation
- faster ttl communication
- LIDAR envoirment scann, room mapping
